# Using $avg

This problem uses the same dataset as we described in using $sum quiz and you should review that quiz if you did not complete it.
Given population data by zip code (postal code) that looks like this:

{
	"city" : "FISHERS ISLAND",
	"loc" : [
		-72.017834,
		41.263934
	],
	"pop" : 329,
	"state" : "NY",
	"_id" : "06390"
}
Write an aggregation expression to calculate the average population of a zip code (postal code) by state. As before, the postal code is in the _id field and is unique. The collection is assumed to be called "zips" and you should name the key in the result set "average_pop".

Answer:
db.zips.aggregate([{$group:{"_id": "$state", "average_pop": {"$avg": "$pop"}}}])
