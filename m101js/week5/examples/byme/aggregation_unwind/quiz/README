# $unwind

Suppose you have the following collection:
db.people.find()
{ "_id" : "Barack Obama", "likes" : [ "social justice", "health care", "taxes" ] }
{ "_id" : "Mitt Romney", "likes" : [ "a balanced budget", "corporations", "binders full of women" ] }
And you unwind the "likes" array of each document. How many documents will you wind up with?
