# Index Creation, Sparse

Suppose you had the following documents in a collection called people with the following docs:
> db.people.find()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("50a464fb0a9dfcc4f19d6271"), "name" : "Andrew", "title" : "Jester" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("50a4650c0a9dfcc4f19d6272"), "name" : "Dwight", "title" : "CEO" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("50a465280a9dfcc4f19d6273"), "name" : "John" }
And there is an index defined as follows:
db.people.ensureIndex({title:1}, {sparse:1})
If you perform the following query, what do you get back, and why?
db.people.find({title:null})


(OK) No documents, because the query uses the index and there are no documents with title:null in the index.

No documents, because querying for title:null only finds documents that explicitly have title:null, regardless of the index.

The document for John, because the query won't use the index.

All the documents in the collection, because title:null matches all documents.

The document for John, because the ensureIndex command won't succeed in this case.
