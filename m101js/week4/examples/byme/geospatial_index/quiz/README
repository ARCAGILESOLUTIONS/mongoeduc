# Geospatial Indexes

Index creation example:
- 'location' : [x, y]
- ensureIndex({'location': '2d', type:1})
- db returns results by incresing distance

Question:
Suppose you have a 2D geospatial index defined on the key location in the collection places. Write a query that will find the closest three places (the closest three documents) to the location 74, 140.

Answer: 
db.places.find({ location : {$near : [74,140] }}).Limit(3);
