# Using Explain

Given the following output from explain, what is the best description of what happened during the query?
{
	"cursor" : "BasicCursor",
	"isMultiKey" : false,
	"n" : 100000,
	"nscannedObjects" : 10000000,
	"nscanned" : 10000000,
	"nscannedObjectsAllPlans" : 10000000,
	"nscannedAllPlans" : 10000000,
	"scanAndOrder" : false,
	"indexOnly" : false,
	"nYields" : 7,
	"nChunkSkips" : 0,
	"millis" : 5151,
	"indexBounds" : {
		
	},
	"server" : "Andrews-iMac.local:27017"
}
