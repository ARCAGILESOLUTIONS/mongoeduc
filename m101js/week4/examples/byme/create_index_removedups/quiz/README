# Index Creation, Removing Dups

If you choose the dropDups option when creating a unique index, what will the MongoDB do to documents that conflict with an existing index entry?


Move them to an archive collection.

Unset the conflicting key so that they can be indexed and remain in the collection.

Remove them but write the deleted documents in JSON to a special file in the log directory.

(OK) Delete them for ever and ever, Amen.
