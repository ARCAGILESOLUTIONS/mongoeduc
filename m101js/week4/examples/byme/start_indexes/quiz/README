#Â Indexes

Which optimization will typically have the greatest impact on the performance of a database?


Adding more memory so that the working set fits in memory.

Adding a faster drive so that operations that hit disk will happen more quickly.

Replacing your CPU with a faster one (say one 2x as fast).

(OK) Adding appropriate indexes on large collections so that only a small percentage of queries need to scan the collection.
